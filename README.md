# 🚨 Smoke/Gas Detector Circuit

A compact and affordable smoke/gas detection system using the **MQ-2 gas sensor**, designed for early fire warning. The system was built using **Proteus simulation**, **breadboard prototyping**, and **PCB implementation** for real-world testing.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project detects flammable gases like smoke, methane, and LPG. When gas is detected above a threshold, the system triggers an **LED** and **buzzer** as a dual alert mechanism.

- 📦 Fully simulated using **Proteus** and **Tinkercad**
- ⚡ Implemented on both **breadboard** and **fabricated PCB**
- 🔋 Stable power regulation with **LM7805**

---

## 🧠 My Role

- Designed the full schematic and PCB layout using Proteus
- Simulated and debugged the circuit
- Assembled and calibrated the sensor and components on breadboard and PCB
- Performed real-world testing with and without gas exposure
